# TODO

* each profile should be a database, not a row in a collection
* create new profile
* renaming profiles? is that needed?
* collect all activity (reads as well as updates)
* activity reporting
* change history - audit trail
* authentication
* authorization (granular)
* merging silos (coalescing profiles)
* forking a silo or profile
* moving a profile to a new silo
* synchronizing data between profiles in different silos

# Questions

* Can you delete a profile? What happens to all the data? Is that irrevocable?


# Features

* "install" a profile onto a device from a different silo from others already on the device - e.g. if you want to allow a friend (temporarily or permanently) to use your device and access apps using data they have accumulated elsewhere
